# [The Secret in One Million Checkboxes](https://eieio.games/essays/the-secret-in-one-million-checkboxes/)

In the blog post "The Secret Inside One Million Checkboxes," written by Nolen (eieio), the author shares their unexpected journey after launching One Million Checkboxes, a personal project that took on a life of its own. Initially expecting minimal engagement, the site attracted 500,000 players who interacted with the checkboxes in creative ways. The author soon realized that binary-encoded URLs had appeared in the database, uncovering that a group of teens had been experimenting with the system, creating animations and encoded messages in the process.

This story is a reminder of the value of personal projects. The best way to learn is by building something that excites you and gaining skills along the way. The author's project not only became a viral success but also inspired a community of creative users to engage in ways they had never anticipated. For me, it's a reminder to take the leap of faith and pursue my own personal projects &#8212; building things I find interesting, regardless of whether they will succeed or not.
